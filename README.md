# ping-pong-sdl
This is an arcade ping-pong simulator. Yet this game is pretty minimalistic, it's architecture was designed to be easily scalable to a larger project with 2D graphics.

It is made using C++ and SDL, a library that provides low-level acess to audio and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.
